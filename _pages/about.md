I am a highly motivated National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS)-funded postdoctoral fellow in Tara DeSilvaâ€™s laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. I have 8+ years of experience conducting neuroimmunological research in team-oriented and collaborative environments on mechanisms underlying autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease with expertise in molecular biology techniques, immunohistochemistry and microscopy, utilization of preclinical models, ex vivo and in vitro calcium imaging, and rodent behavioral analyses. My responsibilities in the laboratory also include development of SOPs, writing and revision of Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and IACUC protocols, grants, and manuscripts, and acting as point of contact during laboratory safety and IACUC inspections. I am also knowledgeable in the Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol submission process, IHC/GCP, HIPAA regulations, and clinical trial design, and have experience designing and conducting human subjects research. I have mentored several students in the DeSilva laboratory and have experience training and managing students and junior staff of all levels in neuroscience, neuropathology, animal husbandry, and laboratory techniques. I am a self-motivated learner with capability in Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook), Google Docs, graphics editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape), video editing software (Sony Movie Studio Platinum), statistical analysis software (Prism, SPSS), and web design languages (HTML, CSS).
