I am a highly motivated National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS)-funded postdoctoral fellow at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. I am passionate about transforming patients' lives through drug discovery, innovation, and service, and have dedicated myself for over 9 years to the discovery of potential therapeutic targets and/or mechanisms of disease utilizing preclinical models. My research expertise is in immunology, neuroscience, and ophthalmology, and I have experience in a wide range of laboratory techniques including molecular biology techniques, immunohistochemistry and microscopy, utilization of preclinical models, <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> calcium imaging, and rodent behavioral analyses. I have experience developing SOPs, writing and revising Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and IACUC protocols, grants, and manuscripts, and acting as point of contact during laboratory safety and IACUC inspections. I am also knowledgeable in the Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol submission process, IHC/GCP, HIPAA regulations, and clinical trial design, and have experience designing and conducting human subjects research. I have given award-winning presentations to national and international audiences and have mentored several students and junior staff of all levels in neuroscience, neuropathology, animal husbandry, and laboratory techniques. I am a self-motivated learner with capability in Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook), Google Docs, graphics editing software (Photoshop, GIMP, Inkscape), video editing software (Sony Movie Studio Platinum), statistical analysis software (Prism, SPSS), and web design languages (HTML, CSS).
