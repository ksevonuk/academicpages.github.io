I am a highly motivated National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS)-funded postdoctoral fellow in <a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/neurosci/desilva/" target="_blank">Tara DeSilva's</a> laboratory at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute. I have 8+ years of experience conducting neuroimmunological research in team-oriented and collaborative environments on mechanisms underlying autoimmune neuroinflammatory disease with expertise in molecular biology techniques, immunohistochemistry and microscopy, utilization of <i>in vivo</i> models, <i>ex vivo</i> and <i>in vitro</i> calcium imaging, and rodent behavioral analyses. Additionally, my duties in the laboratory include development of SOPs for laboratory techniques, data analysis, and use of hazardous materials, writing and revision of Institutional Biosafety Committee (IBC) and IACUC protocols, grants, and manuscripts, and acting as point of contact during laboratory safety and IACUC inspections. I'm also knowledgeable in the Institutional Review Board (IRB) protocol submission process and clinical trial design. I've mentored several students in the DeSilva laboratory and have experience teaching and training students of all levels in neuroscience, neuropathology, animal husbandry, and laboratory techniques. I'm also a self-motivated learner with capability in Microsoft Office (Excel, PowerPoint, Word, Outlook), Google Docs, graphics editing software (Photoshop, Gimp, Inkscape), video editing software (Sony Movie Studio Platinum), statistical analysis software (Prism, SPSS), and web design languages (HTML, CSS).
