Professional Appointments
======
<hr>
  * **Postdoctoral Fellow**
      * Department of Neurosciences, Cleveland Clinic Lerner Research Institute, Cleveland, OH
	  * **Dates:** 2016-present
      * **Advisor:** Tara M. DeSilva, PhD
	  * Demonstrated that deletion of a subunit of the AMPA-type glutamate receptor on mature oligodendrocytes confers protection to myelin and axons in an animal model of multiple sclerosis. This work resulted in a peer-reviewed publication in AAAS Science Advances. Postdoctoral work was funded through a 1-year Cole Eye Institute Vision Science Training Program T32 and a 3-year NMSS Postdoctoral Fellowship. Mentored 2 undergraduate students and 1 high school student in the DeSilva laboratory.

  * **Graduate Research Trainee**
      * Department of Neurobiology, University of Alabama at Birmingham, Birmingham, AL
	  * **Dates:** 2012-2016
      * **Advisor:** Tara M. DeSilva, PhD
	  * Demonstrated amelioration of an animal model of multiple sclerosis by blocking the system xc- glutamate/cystine transporter using pharmacological and genetic methods. Published 3 peer-reviewed, first-author papers resulting from graduate research efforts. Graduate work was funded through a 2-year Immunologic Diseases and Basic Immunology T32. Mentored 4 summer research undergraduate students in the DeSilva laboratory for 10-week laboratory experiences.
