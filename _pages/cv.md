Research Description
======
My research interest is in understanding the mechanisms underlying neuroinflammation and demyelination in autoimmune neuroinflammatory diseases. One such disease is multiple sclerosis (MS), in which autoreactive immune cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS), causing demyelination and neurodegeneration. Current treatments for MS reduce clinical relapses or dampen symptoms by modulating the immune system. However, most of these treatments are not effective for progressive MS, and none are cures for the disease, highlighting the need for studies focusing on neuroprotective mechanisms to directly protect the CNS. One promising target in the search for neuroprotective therapeutic targets is excitotoxicity, defined by excessive stimulation of cells by the excitatory neurotransmitter glutamate. My current projects in the DeSilva laboratory focus on the role of excess glutamate signaling in the pathogenesis of MS, and the normal role of glutamate signaling in the development of myelin. Understanding normal and pathological glutamate signaling in oligodendrocytes will facilitate future research in the neuroprotective potential of glutamate signaling regulation.
