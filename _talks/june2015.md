Symposium theme: Etiopathogenic, immunological and clinical concepts

Abstract: While glutamate dysregulation in the CNS has been implicated in the pathological processes of multiple sclerosis, the causal link between inflammation and glutamate dysregulation is not well understood. A major source of glutamate during oxidative stress is the system xc- transporter, however, this mechanism has not been tested in animal models of autoimmune inflammatory demyelination. We find that pharmacological and genetic inhibition of system Xc- attenuates experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). We discovered that pharmacological blockade of system xc- in C57BL/6 mice attenuates T cell infiltration into the CNS but not proliferation or activation of immune cells in the periphery. Consistent with a reduction in immune cell infiltration, blocking system xc- also reduced reactive gliosis and myelin loss. Additionally, mice harboring a Slc7a11 (xCT) mutation, resulting in the inaction of system xc-, were resistant to EAE indicating a central role for system xc- in EAE pathology. Taken together, these data corroborate system xc- as a mediators of T cell infiltration in the CNS.
