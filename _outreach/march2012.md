The University of Alabama at Birmingham partners with the McWane Science Center annually for Brain Awareness Week (a campaign coordinated by the <a href="https://www.dana.org/About/DABI/" target="_blank">Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives</a>) to educate children and their parents about the central nervous system. I volunteered to host the brain and eye dissection activity for a 3 hour time slot to demonstrate central nervous system anatomy and function.
