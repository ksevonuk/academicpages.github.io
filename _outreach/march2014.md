During the charity walk for multiple sclerosis (MS), Walk MS, I volunteered as a research educator to demonstrate normal and abnormal functioning of myelin and neurons at a booth for walk participants.

Demonstrations included functional modeling of myelin and axons, and short lectures on cellular anatomy and the pathophysiology of MS.
