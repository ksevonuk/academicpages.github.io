The University of Alabama at Birmingham partners with the McWane Science Center annually for Brain Awareness Week (a campaign coordinated by the <a href="https://www.dana.org/About/DABI/" target="_blank">Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives</a>) to educate children and their parents about the central nervous system. I assissted in the planning of Brain Awareness Week from October 2013-March 2014.


My specific planning duties included volunteer coordination and budget planning. Additionally, I volunteered as a demonstration host for a 3 hour time slot to perform brain and eye dissections.
