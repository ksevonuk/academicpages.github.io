As a member of the Lerner Postdoctoral Association's (LPDA) Communications Team, I was responsible for turning interviews from fellows and alumni into featured articles for the Lerner Trainee Newsletter, and editing the newsletter before publication. The Lerner Trainee Newsletter includes accomplishments of Lerner Trainees, upcoming and past events, a monthly feature, and job openings, and is published on a monthly basis on the Cleveland Clinic Research and Education Training Center's <a href="https://www.lerner.ccf.org/education/postdoc/arriving/" target="_blank">website</a>.
