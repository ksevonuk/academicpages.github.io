I served as a planning committee member for the National Multiple Sclerosis Society (NMSS) Tykeson Fellows Conference for fellows funded by the NMSS. My roles included assisting with development of the conference agenda, selecting invited speakers, and judging fellow abstracts for selection of conference speakers. I was interviewed regarding my role on the planning committee for the conference in the <a href="https://www.nationalmssociety.org/Breakthrough-MS/Quarterly-Updates/Winter-2019-2020" target="_blank">NMSS Quarterly Updates newsletter</a>.
