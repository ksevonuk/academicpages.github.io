Abstract:

**Introduction**
Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that results in demyelination and axonal damage. While current treatments for the disease reduce clinical relapses of symptoms by dampening the immune response or preventing immune cell infiltration into the CNS, CNS inflammation and disease progression persist. This highlights the need for studies focusing on mechanisms that protect the CNS from degeneration. Oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to excitotoxicity and patients with MS have elevated levels of glutamate in the brain as measured by MRI. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrates that glutamate release from the system xc- transporter is an important mechanism for myelin damage in mice subjected to autoimmune demyelination. Here, we focus on the target for excitotoxic glutamate in oligodendrocytes, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor. We hypothesize that deletion of the AMPA receptor (AMPAR) results in protection of oligodendrocytes from excitotoxic damage in an animal model of multiple sclerosis.

**Methods**
AMPARs were selectively deleted from oligodendrocytes in C57BL/6 mice as a result of Cre expression under one of two oligodendrocyte-specific promoters: Olig2 and PLP. These oligodendrocyte-specific promoters were chosen to rule out immunomodulatory effects, since glutamate receptors are expressed on immune cells, as well as the contribution of AMPAR expression on neurons. Mice were subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis at 8-14 weeks of age, resulting in progressive and chronic demyelination and paralysis of the hind limbs. Severity of paralysis was scored daily and spinal cords taken at peak of disease (days 16-17) to assess immune cell infiltration by flow cytometry, or after 30 days to assess extent of demyelination, axonal damage, and reactive gliosis.

**Results**
We found that mice subjected to autoimmune demyelination and deficient in AMPARs on oligodendrocytes had improved clinical scores and reduced myelin damage. Furthermore, axonal damage in conditional knockout mice was abrogated as evidenced by 3D-reconstruction of axons using confocal imaging. To confirm that abrogation of disease activity was CNS-specific, analysis of CNS-infiltrating immune cells by flow cytometry demonstrated no changes in conditional knockout mice compared to littermate controls.

**Conclusions**
These data support that AMPARs expressed on oligodendrocytes mediate damage to both the oligodendrocyte and the neuronal axon, suggesting the importance of myelin maintenance for axonal health in MS. Additionally, these data provide rational for further study of therapeutics that prevent excitotoxicity in MS, whether via inhibition of glutamate receptors or sources of excitotoxic glutamate such as the system xc- transporter.
