Abstract:

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease of the central nervous system (CNS) that results in demyelination  and  axonal  damage.  While  current  treatments  for  the  disease  reduce  clinical  relapses  of  symptoms by dampening the immune response or preventing immune cell infiltration into the CNS, they are not completely effective in attenuating disease progression. This highlights the need for studies focusing on mechanisms that protect the CNS from degeneration. Oligodendrocytes are vulnerable to excitotoxicity and patients with MS have elevated levels of glutamate in the brain as measured by MRI. Previous work from our laboratory demonstrates that glutamate release from the system xc- transporter is an important mechanism for  myelin  damage  in  mice  subjected  to  autoimmune  demyelination.  Here,  we  focus  on  the  target  for  excitotoxic glutamate in oligodendrocytes, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor. Targeted deletion of AMPA receptors (AMPARs) selectively on oligodendrocytes was used to rule out immunomodulatory effects, since glutamate receptors are expressed on immune cells, as well as the contribution of AMPAR expression on neurons.  We  found  that  mice  subjected  to  autoimmune  demyelination  and  deficient  in  AMPARs  on  oligodendrocytes had improved clinical scores and reduced myelin damage. Furthermore, axonal damage in conditional  knockout  mice  was  abrogated  as  evidenced  by  3D-reconstruction  of  axons  using  confocal  imaging.  Additionally,  amyloid  precursor  protein  expression  was  reduced  in  spinal  cord  axons  from  conditional knockout mice compared to littermate control mice. To confirm that abrogation of disease activity was CNS-specific, analysis of CNS-infiltrating immune cells by flow cytometry demonstrated no changes in conditional knockout mice compared to littermate controls. These data support that AMPARs expressed on oligodendrocytes  mediate  damage  to  both  the  oligodendrocyte  and  the  neuronal  axon,  suggesting  the  importance of myelin maintenance for axonal health in MS.
