Abstract:

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a neuroinflammatory disease defined by demyelination and axonal damage. The most common form of MS is relapsing-remitting (RRMS), whereby exacerbations of symptoms are followed by a period of remission. A relapse is defined as a clinical event involving the onset of neurological symptoms caused by CNS inflammation. However, the number of inflammatory events in the CNS of MS patients far outnumbers clinical relapses. Current treatments for the disease are immunomodulatory and fail to fully eliminate these inflammatory events and relapses. Therefore, discovery of treatments that directly protect the CNS during immune cell infiltration is of high importance. Patients with MS have elevated levels of glutamate in the brain as measured by MRI, implicating excitoxic mechanisms in CNS damage. Our laboratory recently showed that inhibition of a source of excitotoxic glutamate, the system xc- transporter, after disease onset in an animal model of MS results in reduced clinical symptoms and demyelination. To further explore the target of excitotoxic glutamate, the AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) were selectively deleted on oligodendrocytes since numerous cell types in the CNS and immune system also express AMPARs. Using conditional knockout mice with two different oligodendrocyte promoters, we found that selective deletion of AMPARs on oligodendrocytes in adult C57Bl/6 mice subjected to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) results in improved clinical scores and reduced myelin damage in the thoracic and lumbar regions of the spinal cord. To confirm that the abrogation of disease activity was CNS-specific, analysis of CNS-infiltrating immune cells by flow cytometry was performed and no changes were found in knockout mice compared to littermate controls. To further exclude changes in peripheral immune cell activity, T cell proliferation in spleens was assessed and no changes were found. These data support that AMPA receptor expression on oligodendrocytes mediates excitotoxic damage in autoimmune demyelination providing potential therapeutic implications for CNS protection in MS.
