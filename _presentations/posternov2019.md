Abstract:

Glutamate dysregulation is implicated in multiple sclerosis (MS), but whether excitotoxic mechanisms specific to mature oligodendrocytes contribute to myelin degradation and impact axonal injury has not been explored. Current treatment strategies modulate the immune system; however, long-term disability ensues highlighting the need for neuroprotective therapies. Elevated levels of glutamate are detected prior to the appearance of new T2-visible white matter lesions implicating glutamate as an important excitotoxin in patients with MS. We previously reported that myelin-reactive T cells provoke microglia to release glutamate from the system xc- transporter promoting myelin degradation during autoimmune demyelination. Here, we focus on the target for excitotoxic glutamate in mature oligodendrocytes, the AMPA-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR). The majority of glutamate-stimulated calcium influx into oligodendrocyte cell bodies is AMPAR-mediated, and genetic deletion of the GluA4 AMPAR subunit decreased intracellular calcium responses. Inducible deletion of GluA4 on mature oligodendrocytes diminished the clinical symptoms of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) and histopathological examination of the lumbar spinal cord revealed a reduction in myelin and axonal loss. At the ultrastructural level, loss of myelinated axons was selectively attenuated compared to unmyelinated axons. These data link AMPAR signaling in mature oligodendrocytes to the pathophysiology of myelinated axons and the clinical outcome in EAE, demonstrating the potential benefit of glutamate regulation as a neuroprotective strategy in MS.


Lay summary:

Glutamate is a chemical normally used by cells in communication. However, one factor implicated in damage to myelin and nerves in MS is excitotoxicity, defined as over-excitation of cells in the brain and spinal cord due to excessive glutamate release. This projectâ€™s objective was to study the contribution of the docking sites for glutamate on myelin to MS development. We show that deleting these molecules in a rodent model of MS results in reduced clinical symptoms, myelin damage, and nerve cell damage in the spinal cord. These data indicate the potential for targeting glutamate regulation for future therapies to protect the  nervous system in MS.
