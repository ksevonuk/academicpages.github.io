Abstract:

**Background:** Glutamate dysregulation has been implicated as an important pathological mechanism in multiple sclerosis (MS). In patients with MS, elevated levels of glutamate are predictive of the appearance of new T2-visible white matter lesions implicating glutamate as an important excitotoxin. We previously demonstrated that MOG-reactive T cells induce glutamate release from microglia via the system xc- transporter, resulting in demyelination during experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Here, we explored the target for excitotoxic glutamate. Neurons and oligodendrocytes (OLs) are susceptible to excitotoxicity, making it unclear if damage to myelin is facilitated subsequent to neuronal dysfunction. The objective of this study is to determine whether inducible deletion of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) on mature OLs prevents myelin and axonal damage in EAE.

**Methods:** Constitutive and inducible deletion of the GluA4 AMPAR subunit was achieved using two OL-specific promoters: Olig2 and Plp1, respectively. AMPAR function was determined by calcium imaging of ex vivo optic nerves. Mice were induced with EAE andDemyelination, axonal damage, and reactive gliosis were determined 30 days post-EAE induction by immunohistochemistry.

**Results:** The majority of glutamate-stimulated Ca2+ influx into OL cell bodies is AMPAR-mediated, and genetic deletion of the GluA4 AMPAR subunit decreased intracellular calcium responses. Constitutive and inducible deletion of GluA4 on mature myelinating OLs in mice induced with EAE improved clinical scores and reduced myelin damage. Furthermore, selective deletion of GluA4 on mature OLs prevented axonal loss and reduced axonal injury.

**Conclusion:** These data provide evidence that specifically deleting AMPAR-mediated calcium influx in mature OLs not only prevents demyelination but protects axons from injury. This demonstrates the potential benefit of glutamate regulation as a neuroprotective strategy in MS.
