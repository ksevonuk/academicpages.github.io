Abstract:

Multiple sclerosis (MS) is an autoimmune disease involving a number of pathophysiological mechanisms thought to contribute to myelin loss, axonal damage, and neurological dysfunction. One potential mechanism is excessive glutamate release and excitotoxic cell death. While excitotoxicity has been shown to be involved in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, the source of excess glutamate is not known. In this study, we evaluated the role of the system xc- cystine/glutamate antiporter as the potential source of excitotoxic glutamate in EAE. Using primary cell cultures we show that microglia, in response to cytokines released by TH1 cells, produce nitric oxide resulting in energy failure, glutamate release, and excitotoxic oligodendrocyte death. Inhibition of the system xc- antiporter alleviated excitotoxic oligodendrocyte death in this inflammatory in vitro paradigm. Inhibition of the system xc- antiporter was also beneficial in vivo, improving histopathological and clinical outcomes of EAE in C57BL/6 and SJL/J mice. These data suggest a role for the system xc- antiporter in contributing to the excitotoxic cell environment in MS, and indicate that inhibition of the antiporter may be beneficial by preventing cell death in those with MS.
