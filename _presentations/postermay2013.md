The research I presented in this poster demonstrated a potential role for excitotoxic cell death in the pathogenesis of autoimmune demyelination. Some of the work was conducted as part of my graduate training under my mentor Dr. Tara DeSilva at the University of Alabama at Birmingham.

Abstract:

Multiple sclerosis is an autoimmune disease characterized by myelin loss and axonal damage due to infiltration of immune system cells into the central nervous system (CNS).  The mechanisms that lead to loss of myelinating oligodendrocytes (OLs) are not fully understood. Current treatments in multiple sclerosis focus on attenuating immune cell infiltration into the central nervous system. These treatments decrease the number of relapses, but do not completely eliminate relapses (i.e. immune cell infiltration into the brain) warranting treatment strategies that protect the brain. The aim of the current study was to elucidate some of the mechanisms that lead to demyelination, including interactions between TH1 and TH17 cells, cytokines, microglia, and OLs. One candidate mechanism is excitotoxic cell death as a result of increased glutamate release from surrounding cells. In the current study, we show that IFN-γ and TNF-α can induce the formation of a cytotoxic environment through increased microglial production of nitric oxide (NO) resulting in energy failure and release of glutamate through the system Xc- transporter (a cystine-glutamate antiporter). Blocking the system Xc- transporter in this in vitro model of inflammation was protective to OLs. Furthermore, we also demonstrate that blocking the system Xc- transporter in a mouse model of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) decreases severity of EAE symptoms. These data taken together suggest an important role for excitotoxicity in the demyelination that occurs in MS.
