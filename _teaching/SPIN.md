The University of Alabama at Birmingham's Summer Program in Neuroscience (SPIN) funds motivated undergraduates to conduct research in a laboratory for 10 weeks during the summer. I am an alumni of the program (2010) and acted as a graduate student mentor to several students in subsequent years within the DeSilva laboratory.
