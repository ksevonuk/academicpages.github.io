During Walk MS 2014 I volunteered as a research educator to demonstrate normal and abnormal functioning of myelin and neuronal communication at a booth for walk participants.

Demonstrations included creating myelin out of clay to wrap popsicle stick "axons," and the use of damaged string lights to represent interrupted neuronal communication.
