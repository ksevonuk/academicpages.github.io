The University of Alabama at Birmingham partners with the McWane Science Center annually for Brain Awareness Week (a campaign coordinated by the <a href="https://www.dana.org/About/DABI/" target="_blank">Dana Alliance for Brain Initiatives</a>) to educate children and their parents about the central nervous system. I was co-coordinator of Brain Awareness Week from September 2014-April 2015.


My specific duties included advertisement, volunteer coordination and training, budget planning and purchasing, inventory management, and educational program generation. Additionally, I volunteered as a demonstration host for two 3 hour time slots to perform brain and eye dissections.
