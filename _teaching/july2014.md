The University of Alabama at Birmingham Center for Community OutReach Development <a href="https://www.uab.edu/cord/program/41-summer-science-institute" target="_blank">Summer Science Institute</a> offers high school students summer research experiences accompanied by educational sessions introducing molecular biology and principles of biology and neurobiology. I developed and delivered a one hour lecture to high school students on basics of neuroscience, including neuronal anatomy and function, and roles of glia in health and disease.
