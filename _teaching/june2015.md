The <a href="https://www.uab.edu/medicine/peds/cpodd" target="_blank">CPODD</a> Family Retreat at Children's Harbor on Lake Martin is an annual camp held for children with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica and their families, giving families the opportunity to connect and share experiences and resources. I attended the camp for a day and delivered an hour-long lecture to adult family members on the role of oligodendrocytes in the central nervous system, and pathophysiology associated with demyelinating diseases. The lecture included modeling of the myelin sheath on axons and a question-and-answer session.
