The <a href="https://www.uab.edu/medicine/peds/cpodd" target="_blank">CPODD</a> Family Retreat at Children's Harbor on Lake Martin is an annual camp held for children with multiple sclerosis and neuromyelitis optica and their families, giving families the opportunity to connect and share experiences and resources. I attended the camp for one day to give a parent educational session on neurons and myelin, and mechanisms involved in autoimmune demyelination.
