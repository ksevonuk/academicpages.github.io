Abstract:

Despite being a significant underlying pathogenesis in autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating diseases, the mechanisms resulting in T cell infiltration into the central nervous system (CNS) are not well understood. Dysregulation of glutamate has been implicated in modulating blood-brain barrier permeability and may contribute to T cell infiltration of the CNS in pathological conditions. Here, we examine the role of the system xc- transporter, a glutamate release mechanism, in experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE). Pharmacological inhibition of system xcin C57BL/6 mice attenuates T cell infiltration into the CNS but not proliferation or activation of immune cells in the periphery. These data were consistent with decreased clinical scores, reactive gliosis, and myelin loss. Furthermore, mice harboring a Slc7a11 (xCT) mutation resulting in inactive system xc- were resistant to EAE, indicating a central role for system xc- in the pathogenesis of EAE. Glutamate has also been implicated in the pathology of multiple sclerosis resulting in excitotoxicity and demyelination after immune cell infiltration. To evaluate the target of glutamate after infiltration, we deleted the GluA4 subunit of the AMPA receptor from Olig2-expressing cells in C57BL/6 mice induced with EAE and observed decreased clinical scores and demyelination in the chronic phase of disease. Taken together, these data corroborate system xc- and glutamate as regulators of T cell infiltration and demyelination in autoimmune inflammatory demyelinating diseases.
