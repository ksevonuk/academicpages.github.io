Abstract:

<b>Background:</b> Glutamate dysregulation has been implicated as an important pathological mechanism
in multiple sclerosis (MS). In patients with MS, elevated levels of glutamate are predictive of the
appearance of new T2-visible white matter lesions implicating glutamate as an important excitotoxin.
We previously demonstrated that MOG-reactive T cells induce glutamate release from microglia via
the system x c - transporter, resulting in demyelination during experimental autoimmune
encephalomyelitis (EAE) in mice. Here, we explored the target for excitotoxic glutamate. Neurons and
oligodendrocytes (OLs) are susceptible to excitotoxicity, making it unclear if damage to myelin is
facilitated subsequent to neuronal dysfunction. The objective of this study is to determine whether
inducible deletion of AMPA-type glutamate receptors (AMPARs) on mature oligodendrocytes
prevents myelin and axonal damage in EAE.

<b>Methods:</b> Constitutive and inducible deletion of the GluA4 AMPAR subunit was achieved using two
OL-specific promoters: Olig2 and Plp1, respectively. AMPAR function was determined by Ca 2+
imaging of ex vivo optic nerves, and protein expression of GluA1-4 determined by
immunohistochemistry. Mice were induced with EAE using MOG 35-55 . CD4 + T cell numbers and
phenotypes in spinal cords, and proliferation in spleens, were analyzed by flow cytometry at peak of
disease to determine potential effects on the immune system resulting from GluA4 deletion in OLs.
Demyelination, axonal damage, and reactive gliosis were determined 30 days post-EAE induction by
immunohistochemistry.

<b>Results:</b> The majority of glutamate-stimulated Ca+ influx into oligodendrocyte cell bodies is AMPAR-
mediated, and genetic deletion of the GluA4 AMPAR decreased intracellular calcium responses.
Constitutive and inducible deletion of GluA4 on mature myelinating (OLs) in mice induced with EAE
improved clinical scores and reduced myelin damage. Furthermore, selective deletion of GluA4 on
mature OLs prevented axonal loss and abrogated amyloid precursor protein (APP) production,
indicating reduced axonal injury. No alterations were observed in numbers or phenotypes of CNS-
infiltrating CD4 + T cells, or in proliferation in spleens.

<b>Conclusion:</b> These data provide evidence that specifically deleting AMPAR-mediated calcium influx
in mature oligodendrocytes not only prevents demyelination but protects axons from injury. This
demonstrates the potential benefit of glutamate regulation as a neuroprotective strategy in MS.
